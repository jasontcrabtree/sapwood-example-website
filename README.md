# Sapwood Demo Financial Services Website

A demo website built using React JS, Gatsby JS, Prismic CMS, Styled-Components, Prismic Slices and a custom brand identity designed in Figma

## Tech Stack

- Gatsby JS
- Prismic CMS
- Styled-Components
- GitHub version control
- Netlify hosting and continuous deployment
- React Helmet for SEO

## TODO

- Use useContext hook to set a global disclaimer acknowledging this is a demo website and no legal liability applies
- Continue accessibility and performance testing
- Build remaining custom components
- Add in further content
- Unique images per brand guidelines
- Change all image instances to Gatsby image
- Fix key props in SliceZone (subset of string content)
- Add Prismic Link resolver and Prismic preview
- Turn Preact plugin back on
- Configure SEO Component
- While GitHub is running (in dev mode) run `npm run preload-fonts` to run font preloading for existing routes. Only works if GitHub is running — use two terminals
